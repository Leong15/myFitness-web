# Project Overview

### Goal: Develop a React Native mobile app that takes user inputs, generates a personalized gym schedule using a combination of rule-based logic and a basic machine learning model (or mock API for now), and allows users to provide feedback for schedule adjustments.

### Tech Stack:

- **Frontend:** React Native for cross-platform mobile app (iOS and Android).<br/>
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for API, hosted in a Docker container.<br/>
- **AI/Model:** Initially rule-based logic, with a placeholder for a future ML model (e.g., scikit-learn or TensorFlow.js).<br/>
- **Version Control:** GitHub for code management and CI/CD.<br/>
- **Deployment:** Docker for containerizing the backend, deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean).<br/>
- **Database:** Firebase or MongoDB for storing user profiles and schedules.<br/>

*Constraints:* One day (8 hours) per week, requiring prioritization of tasks and incremental progress.

# Workflow

### Project Setup:

1. Initialize a GitHub repository for version control.
2. Set up a React Native project for the mobile app.
3. Configure Docker for the backend API.
4. Define the project structure (frontend, backend, and data).


### Development:

1. Build the React Native/ Next js with typescript frontend with screens for user input, schedule display, and feedback.
2. Develop a backend API to process inputs and generate schedules.
3. Implement a rule-based logic system for schedule generation (ML model can be added later).
4. Integrate a database for user data and progress tracking.
5. Containerize the backend with Docker for consistent deployment.

### Tool Selection:

1. Add a UI component in the React Native app for users to select available tools (e.g., dumbbells, resistance bands, treadmill, cables, barbells).
2. Update the backend API to accept tool inputs and adjust schedules based on available equipment.

### Schedule Adjustment:

1. Modify the rule-based logic to map exercises to available tools (e.g., if no cables, suggest bodyweight or dumbbell alternatives).
2. Plan for future ML model to optimize tool-based schedules.


### Data Storage:

1. Store user-selected tools in the database alongside other inputs (height, weight, etc.).


### Feedback Loop:

1. Allow users to update tool availability in feedback, triggering schedule adjustments.


### Testing and Deployment:

1. Test the app locally using Expo or React Native CLI or Next js.
2. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD to automate testing and deployment.
3. Deploy the backend to a cloud platform using Docker.
4. Test the app on iOS/Android simulators or physical devices.


### Iteration:

1. Collect user feedback during a beta phase.
2. Refine the UI and logic based on feedback.
3. Plan for future ML integration for adaptive scheduling.


# Milestones and Time Estimates
The milestones are adjusted to incorporate tool selection and schedule adaptation, keeping the one-day-per-week constraint. I’ve added tasks to existing milestones and introduced one new milestone for tool-based logic. The total timeline extends slightly due to the added complexity.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup and GitHub Initialization

### Tasks :

1. Create a GitHub repository with .gitignore for React Native and Docker.
2. Initialize a React Native project (using Expo for simplicity).
3. Set up a Node.js/Express backend with a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
4. Write a README.md with setup instructions.

Deliverable: GitHub repo with React Native app skeleton and Dockerized backend.
Estimated Time: 1 week (8 hours)

GitHub setup: 1 hour
React Native init: 3 hours
Backend setup with Docker: 3 hours
README and commit: 1 hour

Notes: Use the same README.md from the previous response.

## Milestone 2: User Input Screen with Tool Selection and Basic Backend API

### Tasks :

1. Create a React Native screen for user input (height, weight, age, gender, fitness purpose) and add a multi-select component for tools (e.g., dumbbells, cables, treadmill).
2. Style the UI using Tailwind CSS (twrnc) for consistency.
3. Update the backend API endpoint (/generate_schedule) to accept tool inputs and return a mock schedule.
4. Test API locally with Docker.
5. Commit changes to GitHub.


Deliverable: Input form with tool selection, backend API that processes inputs (including tools) and returns a static schedule.
Estimated Time: 3 weeks (24 hours)

Week 1: Input form UI with basic fields (6 hours)
Week 2: Add multi-select tool component and styling (8 hours)
Week 3: API endpoint update and testing with Docker, GitHub commit (10 hours)


Notes: Use a multi-select picker or checkboxes for tools. Mock schedule can ignore tools initially.
InputScreen.jsjavascript•Milestone 3: Rule-Based Schedule Generation with Tool Adjustment

### Tasks :

1. Implement rule-based logic in the backend to generate schedules based on inputs and available tools (e.g., if no cables, use dumbbells or bodyweight alternatives).
2. Create a React Native screen to display the schedule with tool-specific exercises.
3. Test the end-to-end flow (input → API → schedule display).
4. Push changes to GitHub.


Deliverable: App displays a tool-adjusted schedule based on user inputs and selected tools.
Estimated Time: 3 weeks (24 hours)

Week 1: Rule-based logic for tools (8 hours)
Week 2: Schedule display UI and integration (8 hours)
Week 3: Testing and GitHub commit (8 hours)


Notes: Define exercise mappings (e.g., cable rows → dumbbell rows if cables unavailable). Consult a fitness expert for realistic alternatives.
server.jsjavascript•Milestone 4: Database Integration and Feedback Screen with Tool Updates

### Tasks :

1. Set up Firebase or MongoDB to store user profiles, tools, and schedules.
2. Add a feedback screen in React Native for users to report progress (e.g., weight change, fatigue) and update tool availability.
3. Update backend to store and retrieve user data, including tools, and adjust schedules based on feedback.
4. Test data persistence and retrieval.
5. Commit to GitHub.


Deliverable: App saves user data (including tools) and feedback, adjusts schedules based on updates.
Estimated Time: 3 weeks (24 hours)

Week 1: Database setup and backend integration (8 hours)
Week 2: Feedback screen with tool update UI (8 hours)
Week 3: Testing and GitHub commit (8 hours)


Notes: Use Firestore for simplicity with React Native (@react-native-firebase). Allow users to add/remove tools in feedback.

## Milestone 5: Docker Deployment and CI/CD

### Tasks :

1. Deploy the backend to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS ECS) using Docker.
2. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
3. Test the app with the deployed backend.
4. Update GitHub with deployment scripts.
